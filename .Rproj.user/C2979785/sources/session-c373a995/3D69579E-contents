# What is Reproducibility?

That's okay! Having a plan and good habits helps us get closer to the dream :)

## Doing reproducible research

> **Goal:** being able to re-create the *data and analysis* so that you and others can (ideally) arrive at the *same interpretations* of your results.

So, should we keep everything?

# Habits for Reproducible Research

> **Goal:** being able to re-create the *data and analysis* so that you and others can (ideally) arrive at the *same interpretations* of your results.

~~Keep everything!~~

Keep *almost* everything in such a way that you, or people after you, can (happily?) go back to it.

4 reproducibility principles for achieving this are:

<ol>
  <li value="1"> **Annotate:** explain what you're doing and why. </li>
  <li value="3"> **Automate:** make your decisions explicit by using code. </li>
  <li value="4"> **Share:** provide access to your work. </li>
  <li value="2"> **Hoard:** ... you will still have to keep *almost* everything ...</li>
</ol>

## 1. Annotate <img src="https://libapps-au.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/accounts/1771/images/annotate.png" class="toc-icon" style="float: right; width: 25%; margin-left: 10px;" />


**Write explanations for your future collaborators**\
What? How? *Why?!*

**Habits:** use script headers, use meaningful & human-readable names, comment your code

**Tools:** notebook documents (e.g., R Notebook (.Rmd) files in RStudio)

Here we insert a slide deck with the activity
\
\
\

## 2. Hoard <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blogger_img_proxy/AEn0k_t3BbtzxyAYqbfzPrSXHDX3IeUrRhU1jPOjjOAkW9k0k8IoG8cmFmbm09_SFb0YM7BZrY6Ji_JDYu9zrZQh1PYXO43WmHGH8S04Ib6NHl5UvVru5mKRtas-k50qmohmAw=s0-d" class="toc-icon" style="float: right; width: 25%; margin-left: 10px;" />


**Keep *almost* everything**

**Habits:** backup regularly (daily!), versions of software & packages, store raw data & intermediate steps in data processing, store code & progress on code

**Tools:** backup software (e.g., OneDrive is free for UniBE students),\
version control (e.g., git), online repositories (e.g., GitHub)

Here we insert a slide deck with the activity
\
\
\

## 3. Automate <img src="https://images.lumacdn.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,dpr=2,background=white,quality=75,width=400,height=400/event-covers/yo/f21e0c96-387b-4142-be2b-cb5da5fbc84f.png" class="toc-icon" style="float: right; width: 25%; margin-left: 10px;" />


**Avoid manual manipulation**\
waste of time & error-prone\
decisions are <u>not</u> explicit and can be inconsistent

**Habits:** find+replace, use a scripting language for your analyses, automatically save parameters in the filename.

**Tools:** notebook documents

Here we insert a slide deck with the activity
\
\
\

## 4. Share <img src="https://assets.myket.ir/icons/large/com.appattitude.shareapp_f6f6c04e-10fb-4303-a952-0e783d3bfb38.png" class="toc-icon" style="float: right; width: 25%; margin-left: 10px;" />


**Fundamentally, research is about sharing**\
with collaborators, with other scientists

**Habits:** think about your <u>audience</u> when analyzing (see annotate), share early and often

**Tools:** online repositories for data (e.g., Dryad), code (e.g., GitHub), and papers (e.g., EcoEvoRxiv)
\

## Reproducibility principles

  - **Annotate:** explain what you're doing and why.
  - **Automate:** make your decisions explicit by using code.
  - **Share:** provide access to your work.
  - **Hoard:** keep *almost* everything.

By implementing these reproducibility principles, your workspace can be more like this:
