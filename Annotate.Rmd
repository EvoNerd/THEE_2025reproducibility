This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

## Annotate! (more hashtags, more subtitles)

```{r}
# Plotting speed and distance of cars
plot(cars)

# function to multiply integers from 1 to 10 by a parameter value
multiplierofnumbers1to10 <- function(multiplier){
   numbers <- 1:10
   return(multiplier * numbers)
}

# display results for parameter value set to 3
current_value <- 
results <- multiplierofnumbers1to10(multiplier = current_value)

# print results to console
print(results)



# Loop over parameter values 2, 3, and 4
for(current_value in 2:4){
  # Get the multiples
  results <- get.multiples1to10(multiplier = current_value)
  
  # Construct the filename
  the_filename <- paste("multiples1to10--multiplier", current_value, ".csv")
  
  # Write the vector directly to CSV
  write.csv(results, file = the_filename, row.names = FALSE)
}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
